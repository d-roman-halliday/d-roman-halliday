- 👋 Hi, I’m @d-roman-halliday
- 👀 I’m interested in solutions for Databases and Data Warehousing (anything to do with data, and tools to work with it). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of python and other things as I bring some older projects together.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools, technology and ideas.
- 📫 See my blog on https://datablog.roman-halliday.com/
